# LI2022
Love Island Twitter data collection for the 2021 and 2022 series.

Data was collected from a daily 25k scrape of tweets featuring the keywords "Love Island" or "#LoveIsland" over both series, with daily collections from 
Monday 28/06 to Thursday 05/08 (the first five and a half weeks of Series Seven) and Monday 06/06 to Monday 01/08 (spanning the entirety of series eight). For each day, the data is aggregated to 1) the number of tweets mentioning each contestant, and 2) the number of these tweets featuring a negative keyword (e.g. "hate", "red flag", "toxic", "worst", "sexist", "racist" etc.) Metadata on public votes, couplings, and the islanders is included for both series.
